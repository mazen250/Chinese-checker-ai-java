kindly note that we tried to implement the algorithm as much as we can
find below the things that works and there is another things we could not make it run

we create the board as shown in the figure with number 2 for ai and 3 to human and 1 for available indexes to play with but with some restrictions
0 is unplayable indexes it is just for the star shape

the app run in terminal , there is no gui
we tried to implement the alpha beta pruning

First ,player at the bigining choose the difficulty from easy , meduim and hard whoc control the depth in the minimax function, all the moves works , at the biginning the human start to play and we list to you your current balls woth their indexes
if you tried to play with index that you dont have ball on it you will not be able to do that and you will choose another availble index

when you chose you will have the option to choose a movement from up , right , down , left, up left and so on , all of those are controled by switch statement you only need write the number

if the chosen point has a ball (same number as current player number you can jump to next point withoit replace the point) - please check the screen shots and of course it replace the previus place with 1 so it could be free to chose from another points

if the chosen index has a ball from the other player it cannot be done and will be asked to re enter another place again

then the player play his move the turn automatically change then the turn will be ai's turn
and implemnt the algorithm from the function above

Note: when it's ai turn it keep freeze , we tried alot of ideas but it was not accurate or keep run for a very long time

so kindly accept what we did since we wrote every line of it without copying anything

everything mentioned above works , and the bug also mentioned , so kindly if you couldn't run any part probebly let me know to avoid losing more makrs

Thanks in advance
